# Introduction

MetaZ is an mp4 meta-data editor for OS X.  
It started its life when another great meta-data editor MetaX stopped getting
updated, some of the web-services it used changed in ways that broke
functionality and it had some really anoying (to us at least) little missing
things like no proper window resizing. This lead to us starting MetaZ as a
reimplementation of MetaX with a few ideas of our own sprinkled in there.

# Building

There are some files missing in the git repository that you will need if you
are going to build your own version of MetaZ.

`Plugins/Amazon/Access.h`  
This file contains Amazon AWS access credentials.  
Copy `Plugins/Amazon/Access_template.h` and insert your own credentials.

`App/resources/CowHead.png`  
`App/resources/faded_cow*.png`  
`App/resources/presets.png`  
These files are mostly just taken from MetaX but since I don't have the rights
to use them they are not included in the repository.  
I have though made a tar with these files and uploaded it to github:
[missing.tar.gz](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/griff/metaz/missing.tar.gz)
