# MetaZ AppleScript plugins

This folder contains plugins for MetaZ written in AppleScript.

They are stored both as `.applescript` text documents and as compiled `.scpt`
scripts because they are included in `MetaZ.app` and to compile the scripts
you need a already compiled version of `MetaZ.app`.

To compile the `.applescript` files call the `update.sh` script in this
folder.

```
./update.sh
```
