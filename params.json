{"tagline":"Two letters better than MetaX","name":"Metaz","google":"","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nMetaZ is an mp4 meta-data editor for OS X.  \r\nIt started its life when another great meta-data editor MetaX stopped getting\r\nupdated, some of the web-services it used changed in ways that broke\r\nfunctionality and it had some really anoying (to us at least) little missing\r\nthings like no proper window resizing. This lead to us starting MetaZ as a\r\nreimplementation of MetaX with a few ideas of our own sprinkled in there.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nThere are some files missing in the git repository that you will need if you\r\nare going to build your own version of MetaZ.\r\n\r\n`Plugins/Amazon/Access.h`  \r\nThis file contains Amazon AWS access credentials.  \r\nCopy `Plugins/Amazon/Access_template.h` and insert your own credentials.\r\n\r\n`App/resources/CowHead.png`  \r\n`App/resources/faded_cow*.png`  \r\n`App/resources/presets.png`  \r\nThese files are mostly just taken from MetaX but since I don't have the rights\r\nto use them they are not included in the repository.  \r\nI have though made a tar with these files and uploaded it to github:\r\n[missing.tar.gz](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/griff/metaz/missing.tar.gz)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
