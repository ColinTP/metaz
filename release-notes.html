          Alpha 13 optimizes the search to both make MetaZ more responsive but
          also to reduce the load it puts on search providers like
          <a href='http://www.tagchimp.com/'>tagChimp</a>
          and
          <a href='http://thetvdb.com/'>The TVDB.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Also improved in this release is the support for AppleScript plugins which
          have been reworked to have an API that more resembles folder actions and
          which can now be installed by simply dropping them onto the MetaZ dock icon.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly video type has been changed to reflect changes in iTunes 11 [<a href="https://github.com/griff/metaz/issues/34">34</a>] and to add a few new ones.</p>

          <li>Optimized automatic search by checking and only doing the search when the terms have actually changed</li>
          <li>Made all search plugins process the response in the background</li>
          <li>Fixed problem with search not always getting reported as finished. Caused by ASIHTTPRequest not calling delegate methods when request was canceled before it was started.</li>
          <li>Released search delegate when request is canceled to fix problem with sometimes seing spurious search results from previous searches.</li>
          <li>Commented out a lot of logging in the search plugins because it was getting a bit spamy</li>

        <p>Alpha 12 fixes the regression we had where m4v files where no longer editable [<a href="https://github.com/griff/metaz/issues/27">27</a>].</p>
        <p>
          Finally there is integration with iTunes and a lot of it. You can drag items from iTunes and drop them
          onto either the MetaZ dock icon or the files table. You can copy items from iTunes and paste them into
          the files table. MetaZ has a service in the Services menu of iTunes that opens the selected items in MetaZ.
          Two new When Done actions have been added. One of them, enabled by default, updates the file
          location and tells iTunes to refresh its meta data if the file was added to MetaZ using any of the above
          methods. The other adds any file written by MetaZ to iTunes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This release also contains a reworked notification / event system which is now based on plugins and brings
          with it support for plugins implemented in AppleScript. The two iTunes related completion actions are
          in fact implemented in AppleScript. Though the process for doing so is currently a bit involved it should
          be possible for you to make your own plugins in AppleScript.
        </p>
        <p>The complete list of changes are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forgot to change UTIs in APDataProvider when moving away from our own UTI for m4v files [<a href="https://github.com/griff/metaz/issues/27">27</a>]</li>
