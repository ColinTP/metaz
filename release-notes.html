        <h1>Alpha 13</h1>
        <h3>Changes in version 1.0a13 (4. December 2012)</h3>

<p>Alpha 13 optimizes the search to both make MetaZ more responsive but also to reduce the load it puts on search providers like <a href="http://www.tagchimp.com/">tagChimp</a> and <a href="http://thetvdb.com/">The TVDB</a>.</p>

<p>Also improved in this release is the support for AppleScript plugins which have been reworked to have an API that more resembles folder actions and which can now be installed by simply dropping them onto the MetaZ dock icon.</p>

<p>Lastly video type has been changed to reflect changes in iTunes 11 <a href="https://github.com/griff/metaz/issues/34" class="issue-link" title='Movies being tagged in iTunes as "Home Videos"'>#34</a> and to add a few new ones.</p>

<p>The complete list of changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finally cracked how to do pretty AppleScript event callbacks</li>

<li>Renamed document related applescript queue events</li>
<li>Added an opened document applescript event</li>
<li>Improved Update iTunes plugin by making it look for opened files in iTunes when iTunes is running</li>

<li>Fixed error in The TVDB search where it failed when tv show name was empty</li>
<li>Fixed regression where search could not be started from search field</li>
<li>Fixed image loading retry related crash <a href="https://github.com/griff/metaz/issues/26" class="issue-link" title="MetaZ crashes">#26</a>
</li>
<li>Optimized automatic search by checking and only doing the search when the terms have actually changed</li>
<li>Made all search plugins process the response in the background</li>
<li>Fixed problem with search not always getting reported as finished. Caused by ASIHTTPRequest not calling delegate methods when request was canceled before it was started.</li>
<li>Released search delegate when request is canceled to fix problem with sometimes seing spurious search results from previous searches.</li>
<li>Commented out a lot of logging in the search plugins because it was getting a bit spamy</li>
<li>Set the maximum number of concurrent search operations to 12 like the remote data queue is set to.</li>
<li>Set an error on MZRemoteData when response status code is above 399</li>

<li>Delayed the window in the alert plugin.</li>

        <h1>Alpha 12</h1>
        <h3>Changes in version 1.0a12 (6. November 2012)</h3>

<p>Alpha 12 fixes the regression we had where m4v files where no longer editable <a href="https://github.com/griff/metaz/issues/27" class="issue-link" title="m4v files no longer editable by MetaZ Version 1.0a11 (12.11.02.12.6d9bdbf)">#27</a> </p>

<p>Finally there is integration with iTunes and a lot of it. You can drag items from iTunes and drop them onto either the MetaZ dock icon or the files table. You can copy items from iTunes and paste them into the files table. MetaZ has a service in the Services menu of iTunes that opens the selected items in MetaZ. Two new When Done actions have been added. One of them, enabled by default, updates the file location and tells iTunes to refresh its meta data if the file was added to MetaZ using any of the above methods. The other adds any file written by MetaZ to iTunes.</p>

<p>This release also contains a reworked notification / event system which is now based on plugins and brings with it support for plugins implemented in AppleScript. The two iTunes related completion actions are in fact implemented in AppleScript. Though the process for doing so is currently a bit involved it should be possible for you to make your own plugins in AppleScript.</p>

<p>The complete list of changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forgot to change UTIs in APDataProvider when moving away from our own UTI for m4v files <a href="https://github.com/griff/metaz/issues/27" class="issue-link" title="m4v files no longer editable by MetaZ Version 1.0a11 (12.11.02.12.6d9bdbf)">#27</a>
</li>
<li>Added our own array controller with delayed rearrangement and enabled automaticallyRearrangesObjects for files</li>
<li>Generalized SearchTableView menuForEvent, moved it to UndoTableView and deleted SearchTableView</li>
<li>Fixed spelling error in MZPresets</li>
<li>Removed commented out code</li>
<li>Switched usages of getBytes: in MZScriptingAdditions to getBytes:length: since that is not deprecated and safer</li>
<li>Added NSDecimal support to NSValue</li>
<li>Made NSDecimal support in scripting objectValue use decimalValue which coerces</li>
<li>Added support for alias to scripting objectValue</li>
<li>Added iTunesPersistentID tag</li>
<li>Made allKnownTags return all registered tags</li>
<li>Switched CFBundleVersion of plugins to BUILDVERSION</li>

<li>Merge branch 'feature/scriptactions' into develop</li>

<li>Fixed wrong variable name</li>
<li>Changed queue so status is stopping until notifications have been sent</li>

<li>Added an \"add to iTunes\" plugin fixing <a href="https://github.com/griff/metaz/issues/18" class="issue-link" title="auto add to itunes would be a nice feature">#18</a>
